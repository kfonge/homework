Create a folder with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
Your goal is to create a button that mimics a light switch.
The initial image should be a lightbulb that is OFF. When the user clicks the button, the lightbulb should turn on (switch images) and vice versa.
Besides switching the image, make the ON/OFF button cause at least 3 other visual changes to the page. (Example: Changing the background from black to white)
Use Flex Box or Grid in some way (Example: Centering elements on the page)

// CREATE AN ON-OFF SWITCH AS A BUTTION//

For example, letâ€™s create a <button> that says "Click Me" using JavaScript:

First, you call the document.createElement("button") and assign the returned element to a variable named btn.
Then, assign the "Click Me" string to the btn.innerHTML property
Finally, use document.body.appendChild() to append the button element to the <body> tag
